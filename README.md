Server Side Application

## Framework
We used Sinatra as our framework and Ruby as our programming language. We also used Rake as a database tool to create and migrate our tables.
We have one table to store our accounts
We have two other tables - lyrics and user lyrics. Our lyrics table is used to store our lyrics. We populated our lyrics table with over 100 lyrics. Our userlyrics table stores the lyrics uses save while visiting out site.
We used 3 controllers to route our paths (Accounts, Lyrics, User Lyrics). 
We also have Bcrypt and Authentication.
